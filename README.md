# Overview
JFrog CLI is a compact and smart client that provides a simple interface that automates access to *Artifactory*, *Bintray* and *Mission Control* through their respective REST APIs.
By using the JFrog CLI, you can greatly simplify your automation scripts making them more readable and easier to maintain.
Several features of the JFrog CLI makes your scripts more efficient and reliable:

- Multi-threaded upload and download of artifacts make builds run faster
- Checksum optimization reduces redundant file transfers
- Wildcards and regular expressions give you an easy way to collect all the artifacts you wish to upload or download.
- "Dry run" gives you a preview of file transfer operations before you actually run them

# Download and Installation

You can download the executable directly using the [JFrog CLI Download Page](https://www.jfrog.com/getcli/), or install it with npm, homebrew or docker.
## NPM
````
npm install jfrog-cli-go
````
## Homebrew
````
brew install jfrog-cli-go
````
## Docker
````
docker run docker.bintray.io/jfrog/jfrog-cli-go:latest jfrog <COMMAND>
````

# Building the Executable

JFrog CLI is written in the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/), so to build the CLI yourself, you first need to have Go installed and configured on your machine.

## Install Go

To download and install `Go`, please refer to the [Go documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install).
Please download `Go 1.14.x` or above.

## Download and Build the CLI

Navigate to a directory where you want to create the jfrog-cli project, **outside** the `$GOPATH` tree.

If the `GOPATH` variable is unset, it's default value is the go folder under the user home.

Verify that the `GO111MODULE` variable is either unset, or explicitly set to `auto`.

Clone the jfrog-cli project by executing the following command:
````
git clone https://github.com/jfrog/jfrog-cli
````
Build the project by navigating to the jfrog folder and executing the following commands.
On Unix based systems run:
````
cd jfrog-cli
./build.sh
````
On Windows run:
````
cd jfrog-cli
build.bat
````
Once completed, you will find the JFrog CLI executable at your current directory.
